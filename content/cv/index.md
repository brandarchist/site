From experimentation frameworks to creative automation pipelines, this CV highlights work that bridges product, research, and storytelling. Below is a style board that exercises the common typography and component treatments in the Hugo Blog Awesome theme.

## Typography Palette

Body copy lands at a comfortable reading width so long-form case studies feel calm and confident. Inline **bold**, _italic_, `monospace`, and a combo of **_bold italic_** text all render with clear contrast on both light and dark modes.

### Heading Stack

#### H4 Accent Line

##### H5 Micro Label

###### H6 Meta Caption

The headings above demonstrate the font scale. Switching between them is as simple as using Markdown `##` through `######`.

## Lists & Hierarchy

### Timeline (Ordered)

1. Kickoff narrative arc with a strategic hypothesis.
2. Prototype proof-of-concept automations.
3. Launch governed playbooks with analytics instrumentation.

### Capabilities (Unordered)

- Generative system design
- Policy-aware data wrangling
- Partner enablement + training loops

### Task Style (Pseudo Checklist)

- [x] Research phase
- [ ] Pilot with select partner
- [ ] Broader enablement

## Blockquotes & Callouts

> “Great CVs are tiny story engines. Every line is a narrative hook inviting people to ask for the next chapter.”
>
> — Brandarchist

Use blockquotes for principles or testimonials. Pair them with horizontal rules to shift attention.

## Code & Syntax Highlighting

Inline snippets such as `npm run build` stay readable, and fenced code blocks inherit the Chroma theme:

```go
package cv

func standout(skills []string) string {
	for _, skill := range skills {
		if skill == "systems + storytelling" {
			return "Hire immediately"
		}
	}
	return "Book a call"
}
```

## Tables & Structured Data

| Track              | Focus                       | Signal                               |
|--------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| R&D Playbooks      | Rapid prototyping           | Working demos in 2-week increments    |
| Platform Strategy  | Governance + policy design  | Risk heatmaps + mitigation narratives |
| Partnerships       | Education + enablement      | Reusable workshop kits                |

Tables are perfect for comparison grids or resume bullet compression.

## Accent Utilities

Pair blockquotes with bold intros to simulate callouts, or underline critical lines with emphasis to keep things theme-native.

**Note:** The footer social icons reflect any handles defined under `params.socialIcons`. Keep those updated so collaborators can find your latest workstreams.
